The purpose of this text is to provide a comprehensive view of how this project can benefit various sectors of
the city of Memphis, extending beyond the crime department.

## Real Estate

With the help of this dashboard, real estate agents and property investors can gain valuable insights into the local crime

By analyzing crime data, they can identify areas with lower crime rates suitable for redevelopment and revitalization
efforts. This can lead to improved living conditions, economic growth, and the creation of safer, more vibrant communities.

## School Placement

School districts can leverage the crime data presented in the dashboard to inform decisions about school placement and 
security measures. This information can help ensure that educational institutions are located in areas that prioritize 
student safety and well-being, while parents can make informed choices about their children's education.

## Tourism

Tourists planning their visit to Memphis can benefit from this dashboard by gaining insights into the safety of various 
neighborhoods and attractions. Armed with this knowledge, tourists can make informed decisions about which areas to explore, 
where to stay, and how to ensure a safe and enjoyable visit to the city.

## Community Awareness

One of the primary benefits of this project is its potential to raise community awareness. Residents across Memphis
can use the data and visualizations to become more informed about crime patterns and hotspots in their neighborhoods.
This knowledge empowers communities to take proactive measures, such as organizing neighborhood watch programs and 
collaborating with local authorities, to enhance safety and security.
